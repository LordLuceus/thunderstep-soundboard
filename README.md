# Thunderstep Soundboard

> A browser-based soundboard application built with Next.js and React. Vibe-coded with [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex).

## Overview

A browser-based soundboard application built with Next.js and React. Organize audio clips into banks, assign hotkeys, control playback volume and looping, and back up or restore your entire configuration.

## Features

- Multiple Sound Banks: group related sounds into named banks
- Hotkey Assignment: bind a single key to each sound (scoped per bank)
- Categories: "sound" and "music" types interrupt same-category playback
- Volume Control: global and per-sound volume sliders
- Loop Toggle: inline loop on/off for each sound
- Keyboard Controls: play sounds or stop all via the Escape key
- Accessible UI: ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- Persistence: metadata in localStorage; audio files stored in IndexedDB
- Backup & Restore: export/import all banks and audio data as a JSON file

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19 with Client Components
- TypeScript
- IndexedDB for binary file storage
- ESLint & Prettier with husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lordluceus/thunderstep-soundboard.git
